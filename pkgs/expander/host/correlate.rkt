;; A "correlated" is the host's notion of syntax objects for
;; `compile-linklet`, which is an S-expression with source locations
;; and properties (but no scopes).

;; For historical reasons, the names here can be a bit confusing.  The
;; host layer provides functions named `syntax?`, `datum->syntax`,
;; etc., but these are wrapped here by functions with the names
;; `correlated?`, `datum->correlated`, etc. Additionally,
;; `racket/linklet` obtains the names `syntax?` etc directly from the
;; `#%kernel` primitive table, and provides them under the name
;; `correlated?` etc. This expander defines other functions with the
;; names `syntax?` etc (see "../syntax/syntax.rkt") which are the
;; syntax objects used by this expander.

;; When the expander is run as a regular Racket program, the host
;; notion of syntax is a full Racket syntax object, but the expander
;; ignores all but the contained datum, the properties, and the source
;; location.

;; When the expander is used as the expander for Racket on the older,
;; C-based runtime, it uses a C-level implementation of syntax
;; objects, Scheme_Stx, which contains only the features needed
;; here. In that implementation, the names implemented are `syntax?`,
;; etc.

;; When the expander is run as the Racket expander on the Chez
;; Scheme-based runtime, it uses a record named `correlated` which
;; provides only the features needed here. There, the implemented
;; operations are named `correlated?`, etc, but are provided to this
;; expander as `syntax?`, etc.
